Multi-priority Cartesian Impedance Control based on Quadratic Programming Optimization
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This repository contains a prototype of a Multi-Priority Cartesian Imepdance Controller based on Quadratic Programming Optimization.

To run the examples you need:
- The Robotics Toolbox for Matlab, by Peter Corke that you can find <a href="http://www.petercorke.com/Robotics_Toolbox.html" target="target">here</a>
- The QP solver qpOASES, by H.J. Ferreau et al., that you can find <a href="https://projects.coin-or.org/qpOASES" target="target">here</a>
